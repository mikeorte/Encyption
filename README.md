# Introduction

This is my encryption project. The goals are to be able to have multiple encyption methods, save them to text files, and encrypt the text files

## Things I did:
* Error catching for CaesarCipher and key values
* Made it possible to use capital letters
* Changed the order of the program so that it asked the user what it would like to do before asking for a string
* Used a while loop instead of switch and case

## Things I have to do:
* Make CaesarCipher its own class
* Make new methods of encryption and implement them
* Read and write text files
* Encrypt the actual text tiles
